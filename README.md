#Customer Churn Predictor using PyTorch
This project provided you with hands-on experience in building a complete **machine learning pipeline**, starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation. I used **PyTorch's Neural Network**: nn.module to build the predictor model. I gained valuable skills in deep learning using PyTorch, Sickitlearn, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and performance evaluation. These skills are critical for applying machine learning in real-world business scenarios, particularly in customer analytics and predictive modeling.
